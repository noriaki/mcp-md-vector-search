# Memory Usage Guidelines

## Purpose of Memory Files

The memory files in this project serve to:
- Provide context and continuity across development sessions
- Establish consistent guidelines and patterns
- Track progress and decision history
- Store essential project knowledge

## Memory File Structure

### Rules Directory (`.ai-agent/rules/`)
Contains operational guidelines that govern your behavior and approach to the project.

### Memory Directory (`.ai-agent/memory/`)
Stores project-specific information, current status, and technical context.

### Memory Bank (`.ai-agent/memory-bank/`)
Holds detailed documentation and reference information about complex features, APIs, and technologies.

## Memory Usage Workflow

1. **Start of Session**:
   - Review Active Context file first
   - Check Project Brief and Product Context for requirements
   - Examine Progress file to understand current status

2. **During Development**:
   - Refer to System Patterns and Technical Context
   - Follow guidelines in Rules files
   - Consult Memory Bank for specialized knowledge

3. **End of Session**:
   - Update Active Context with current focus and progress
   - Update Progress file with completed work and new issues
   - Suggest updates to other memory files as needed

## Memory Maintenance Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent structure and naming across memory files
- **Conciseness**: Keep information clear and concise, avoiding redundancy
- **Relevance**: Focus on information relevant to current and future development
- **Currency**: Ensure information is up-to-date, especially in Active Context
- **Organization**: Keep files well-organized and easily navigable

## Updating Memory Files

When you identify the need to update a memory file:

1. Identify the appropriate file for the information
2. Review the current content to understand context
3. Make precise additions or changes while maintaining structure
4. Note significant updates in the Active Context file
5. Suggest memory updates to project stakeholders when necessary

## Cross-referencing

- Use links between memory files to connect related information
- Avoid duplicating information across files
